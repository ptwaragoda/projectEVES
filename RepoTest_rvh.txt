Adding a new item to your repository and uploading it to github:
Open GIT Gui and select "open an existing repository". Navigate to the folder that contains your repository and select open.
Select Repository/Explore Working Copy. You will see your repository folder with your readme file. Add a file to this repository (any file--a word document would be good).
Back in git gui press "Rescan". You will see your file in the working area.
Click on the file. It will move into the staged area.
Click on commit; Git GUI will ask you for a comment. Add a comment in the commit message area e.g. "my first document commit" or whatever.
Click commit again.
Your document is now in your local repository. Now you want to push it to github.
Select remote/push (or the push button). You should see "master" in the source branch and the "remote destination repository" of origin.
Click the push button and you will get some messages with hopefully a success message at the end.
Navigate back to your respository on github. Refresh if you were already there. You should see your document there.
Changing an item in your local repository, then staging it and loading it to your repository and to github.
Make a change to the file you added to your repository e.g. add a line that says "my first git change" or something.
Press rescan in git gui and the document will appear in the git gui window (you will not see any items that have not been changed).
Stage it by clicking on StageChanged.
Commit to the local repository and don't forget your comment e.g. "added a line of text"
Click commit.
Click push and then click push again when you get the remote window.
Now go back into github and check that the document is there.
Click on the history link just above the list of files on the right side of the bar. You should see all of your commits.
